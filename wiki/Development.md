# Development

This page covers building, testing, and the repository layout for contributors.

## Toolchain

- **Rust 1.97.1**, pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (with `rustfmt` and `clippy` components).
- Edition 2024. The workspace `rust-version` is `1.97`.

## Build, test, lint

These are the exact commands CI runs:

```sh
# Format check
cargo fmt --all --check

# Lint (warnings are errors)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings

# Full test suite
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
```

A release build of the CLI and optional desktop addon:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked -p synaptic -p synaptic-ui
```

## Per-language testing

Every language extractor can be built and tested in isolation so a grammar bump that
silently drops nodes or edges fails on its own:

```sh
cargo test -p synaptic-extract --no-default-features --features lang-rust --locked
```

CI runs this across a matrix of grammar-backed languages. See [Languages](Languages).

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request with these gates:

- **lint** - `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy ... -D warnings`.
- **test** - `cargo test --workspace --all-features` on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **mcp-conformance** - exercises the real stdio MCP handshake and tool calls on all three OSes.
- **store-backend** - verifies the sharded store and JSON/redb CLI parity on all three OSes.
- **docs** - builds workspace documentation with rustdoc warnings denied.
- **extract-langs** - a matrix that tests each grammar-backed language on its own
  (`--no-default-features --features lang-<name>`).

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on `v*` tags (and manual dispatch): it cross-compiles
the CLI and UI for Linux (`x86_64`), macOS (`x86_64` and `aarch64`), and Windows (`x86_64`),
packages each with the README/LICENSE/NOTICE/CHANGELOG and locked third-party notices,
publishes checksums and artifact attestations to a GitHub Release, and syncs `wiki/`.

## Benchmarks

For the parser validation corpus and independent compiler checks, see
[`BENCHMARKS.md`](https://github.com/ColinVaughn/Synaptic/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md)
and the linked review reports.
The vendored Groovy grammar includes its source, generated C, regression corpus
and original licenses under `vendor/tree-sitter-groovy/`; ordinary Rust builds
do not need the grammar generator.

Several crates ship Criterion benchmarks (for example `synaptic-extract`,
`synaptic-detect`, `synaptic-output`). Run them with:

```sh
cargo bench
```

The graph-performance release gates can also be run independently:

```sh
cargo bench -p synaptic-graph --bench graph -- graph/duplicate_edge_provenance
cargo bench -p synaptic-graph --bench graph -- graph/scaling/cluster/10000
cargo bench -p synaptic-incremental --bench incremental
cargo bench -p synaptic-workspace --bench workspace -- workspace/compose/16x500
```

The duplicate-provenance benchmark intentionally runs the former repeated-
materialization comparison only through 1,000 sites; the linear accumulator is
also measured at 10,000 sites so the full benchmark remains practical.

The dependency-free agent-token and BEIR adapter has a smoke check:

```sh
python scripts/benchmark-token-savings.py self-test
```

See `BENCHMARKS.md` for paired SWE-bench normalization, statistical gates,
CodeRAG-Bench/BEIR scoring, and historical task materialization.

See [Architecture](Architecture) for what each crate does and how the pipeline fits together.

## Conventions

- All shared dependencies are declared once in the root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]`
  and referenced with `workspace = true` from member crates.
- The graph output is deterministic; tests assert byte-stable `graph.json` where relevant, so
  avoid introducing nondeterministic iteration order.
- Edges carry an explicit confidence level; prefer `INFERRED`/`AMBIGUOUS` over `EXTRACTED`
  when a relationship is heuristic.
