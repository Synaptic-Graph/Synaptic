//! Extraction quality across the pinned real-world corpus.
//!
//! The scale benchmark ([`crate::scale`]) times extraction; a graph that anchored
//! every declaration to the wrong line would post identical timings. This
//! measures whether the graph is *right*, on real repositories, using properties
//! that need no hand labels:
//!
//! - **Anchor exactness** -- the recorded `(file, line)` for a declaration really
//!   does contain that declaration. A 2026-08-13 audit found 1,475 of 31,732
//!   anchors wrong across 14 repositories; that audit was ad hoc, so nothing
//!   stopped the same class of bug returning. This makes it repeatable.
//! - **Parse and recovery health** -- how often the grammar errored, how often a
//!   non-empty source file yielded no declaration at all, and how much the
//!   bounded recovery pass rescued.
//! - **Self-consistency** -- two extractions of one revision must agree, and a
//!   full rebuild must agree with an incremental one. Both have a principled
//!   correct answer, so they are assertions rather than scores.
//!
//! The independent-oracle comparison lives in [`crate::oracle`]; it is the only
//! stage that needs a second tool installed.
